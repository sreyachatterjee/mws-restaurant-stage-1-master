Restaurant Reviews App-Stage 1

In this project, I incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. 
I took a static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays 
and accessible for screen reader use. 
I also added a service worker to begin converting this to a Progressive Web Application by caching some assets for offline use.
I have used Leafletjs, an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps and 
Mapbox, an open source mapping platform for custom designed maps.
I also have used Normalize.css for better cross-browser consistency.
